# Getting Started with Bank Dashboard

## Project UI Design

The design of this [`dashboard project`](https://dribbble.com/shots/18475628-Winden-Dashboard-Experiments) was inspired by [`Oğuz Yağız Kara`](https://dribbble.com/oguzyagiz)
for [`Winden`](https://dribbble.com/windenhq).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
